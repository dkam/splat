- **Issue:** API endpoint `/api/:project_id/envelope` has no rate limiting
- **Risk:** Could be abused, causing resource exhaustion
- **Impact:** Service degradation, increased costs
- **Effort:** Low (a few hours to implement)
- **Solution:** Add Rack::Attack or custom rate limiting

#### MEDIUM Priority (Should-Fix)

**2. Large Transaction Model** üü° 
- **Issue:** Transaction model is 278 lines with too many responsibilities
- **Impact:** Harder to maintain and test
- **Effort:** Medium (extract to service object)

**3. N+1 Query Opportunities** üü°
- **Issue:** Some views may trigger N+1 queries
- **Impact:** Performance degradation with many records
- **Effort:** Low (add `.includes()`)

**4. Broad Exception Handling** üü°
- **Issue:** Some `rescue => e` blocks too generic
- **Impact:** May hide bugs and make debugging harder
- **Effort:** Low (be more specific about exceptions)

#### LOW Priority (Nice-to-Have)

**5. Magic Numbers** üü¢
