  - Test with realistic traffic patterns

### Phase 2: Short-term Improvements (Medium Priority)
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 weeks

- [ ] Extract TransactionStatsService
- [ ] Fix N+1 queries in issue views
- [ ] Improve exception handling specificity
- [ ] Add integration tests for critical flows

### Phase 3: Long-term Enhancements (Low Priority)
**Estimated Time:** Ongoing

- [ ] Replace magic numbers with constants
- [ ] Add API documentation comments
